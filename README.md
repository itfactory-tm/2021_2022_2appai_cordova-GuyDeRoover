## Short description of your app

The idea is the create an application that gives you the possibility to choose from a wide range of wallpapers saved in a database when connected to the internet (see API down below).
If you find a wallpaper that you like you can set it as your phones background with a single press of a button.
If there are wallpapers that you like you can mark them as favorite so they won't get lost.
The wallpapers marked as favorite will be put in local storage so you can always use those wallpapers even without internet.
You will also be able to create your own custom wallpapers by taking pictures with you camera.
If you would wanna print a certain wallpaper to hang in your room you can do that too from your phone.
