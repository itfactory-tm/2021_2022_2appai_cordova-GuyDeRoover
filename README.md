## Short description of your app

This is an Android-only application. With this application, you are able to search for wallpapers based on certain criteria. Wallpapers can be found based on tag, category and purity. The purity filter is default set on "SFW" (Safe For Work) but can be changed in the settings. <br><br>
Every wallpaper can be set as the device's home screen and lock screen background, can be downloaded locally, or saved in favorites inside the application for later use with local storage. Not all wallpapers show the full wallpaper in the preview so there is an option for opening the full wallpaper in Picasso preview by simply clicking on the wallpaper itself. The preview also gives you the option to share the wallpapers with others through email or other sorts of media sharing platforms. <br><br>
If you wish to delete a saved background from your favorites, change your background from your saved favorites or rather download the picture to the device from the favorites tab, then this is possible as well. <br>
